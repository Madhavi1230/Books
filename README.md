# Why are we doing this?

This project serves as the culmination of all of the topics I learned. It involve the following concepts/technologies:

-   Agile & Project Management (Git, Jira)
-   Databases & Cloud Fundamentals (H2, MySQL)
-   Programming Fundamentals (Java)
-   API Development (Spring Boot)
-   Automated Testing (JUnit, Mockito)
   
# How I expected the challenge to go

To create a **Spring Boot API**, with utilization of supporting tools, methodologies, and technologies.
-   An  **application back-end developed**  using the language from Programming Fundamentals module (e.g. Java)
-   A  **managed database**  hosted locally or within the Cloud Provider examined during your Cloud Fundamentals module (e.g. H2 or MySQL (local / GCP)
-   **a means of making API calls**  (Postman) and a  **means of checking persistence**  (Workbench/H2 console)
